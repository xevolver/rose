                    "    are modern enough to display SVG graphics and javascript is enabled, but Chrome is the "
                    "    only one I routinely use for testing.</li>"
                    "<li>It does not support multiple users/sessions talking to the same server.  ROSE is not fully "
                    "    thread safe and no attempt has been made to serialize the server's access to ROSE.</li>"
                    "<li>Backing out of a disassembly leaks a substantial amount of memory. ROSE was designed "
                    "    to primarily support non-interactive workflows and doesn't always clean up well after itself.</li>"
                    "<li>Many, many features are missing.  The server uses only a very small subset of the features "
                    "    available in ROSE.</li>"
                    "<li>No attempt is made to limit the time it takes to generate a control flow graph. If one tries "
                    "    to display the CFG for a large function the server could hang for many minutes.  Some other "
                    "    operations can take many seconds to complete. A red \"Loading...\" indicator will appear at the "
                    "    top right corner of the window.</li>"
                    "<li>The server occassionally crashes, and when this happens it should automatically restart. If you "
                    "    need to forcibly restart it (and it's not hung), clicking on the dark, round logo in the top "
                    "    left of the window should reboot the server (clicking your \"reload\" button will only start a "
                    "    new session in the same browser using the old instance of the ROSE library).</li>"
