This project was removed by Robb Matzke on 2015-09-10 because:

1. It uses deprecated/internal features of the ROSE library.

2. It has not compiled since 2012-03-29 and the original
   author had no intention of fixing it. See commit
   14da0f446532c510aa95641baee8f719a538dc2b

3. The PowerPC instruction semantics have been implemented
   in the ROSE library for quite a while.
