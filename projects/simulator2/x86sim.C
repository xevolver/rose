        .doc("Description", "a",
             "This tool simulates concrete execution of an executable specimen in an unsafe manner. Any system calls made by "
             "the specimen are passed along by the underlying operating system after possible translation by this tool. The "
             "tool emulates various services typically provided by the operating system, such as memory management, signal "
             "handling, and thread support.\n\n"

             "This tool is not intended to be a full-fledged virtual machine, but rather a dynamic analysis platform. "
             "The dynamic nature comes from ROSE's ability to \"execute\" an instruction in a concrete domain, and the "
             "tool's ability to simulate certain aspects of an operating system, including process and thread creation, "
             "signal delivery, memory management, and system call emulation. There may be other alternatives more "
             "suitable to your situation:"

             "@bullet{ROSE can analyze a natively running process.  It does so by attaching to the process as if it "
             "were a debugger and querying the process's state (memory and registers) from the operating system. This is "
             "much less complicated than trying to simulate execution by emulating substantial features of the operating "
             "system.}"

             "@bullet{ROSE has a built-in debugger. ROSE can execute a specimen natively within its own debugger, which "
             "includes the ability to set breakpoints for entire regions of memory (e.g., all addresses). This allows "
             "user-written tools to easily customize execution within the debugger. This can be combined with the previous "
             "bullet to analyze the program both dynamically and staticlly is and is significantly faster than "
             "simulating each instruction.}")

        .doc("Specimen", "x",
             "The specimen can be specified by name or process ID.  If a name is given then the simulator can either "
             "emulate the Linux \"exec\" system call to load the specimen into a simulated process; or it can use Linux "
             "directly to load the specimen into a temporary native process, initialize the simulator from that process, "
             "and then kill that process. The @s{native-load} switch causes the latter behavior.\n\n"

             "If the specimen is specified with a process ID then the simulator attaches to that process, initializes its "
             "memory and registers from that process, and then detaches.  One should note that only memory and registers "
             "are initialized and not the simulated Linux kernel state. In particular, file descriptors open in the process "
             "will not be present in the simulator; parent/child relationships will be broken since the simulator is not "
             "related to the process; the simulated process will have only one thread; any process ID stored in the "
             "simulated memory will be incorrect; pending signals and signal masks will not be initialized from the process; "
             "process real and effective uid and gid may be different; etc.  This method is best used only with a process "
             "that has been just created and then stopped.")

        .doc("Caveats", "z",
             "Speed of simulation is not a primary goal of this tool. ROSE is mostly a static analysis library "
             "whose capabilities happen to include the ability to write a concrete simulation tool.\n\n"

             "Specimen memory is managed in a container within the simulating ROSE process. Therefore operations like "
             "interprocess communication via shared memory will probably never work.  This limitation may also include "
             "intra-process communication with shared memory mapped at two different addresses, and other \"tricks\" that "
             "specimens sometimes do with their memory maps.\n\n"

             "The specimen process and threads are simulated inside this tool's process and threads. Certain operations that "
             "modify process and thread properties will end up modifying the tool's process and threads. For instance, reading "
             "from the Linux \"/proc/@v{n}\" filesystem will return information about the simulator tool rather than "
             "the specimen being simulated. Sending a signal to a process or thread will cause the tool to forward the "
             "signal to the simulated process or thread only if this behavior is enabled at runtime.\n\n"

             "Emulating the fork (clone) system call is not practically possible because the simulator is multi-threaded "
             "even when simulating a single-threaded guest, and the simulator needs to do more than call only async-signal "
             "safe functions after the fork returns in the child. A guest that forks cannot be simulated past the fork. This "
             "includes guests that call C library functions like @man{system}{3} and @man{popen}{3}.\n\n"
