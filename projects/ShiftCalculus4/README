The files contained in this directory define the following classes:

Point: integer vector of dimension DIM.
Box : A rectangular box in space, where the lower 
      corner and upper corner are define as Points
RectMDArray : data container templated on <T> with the 
	    spatial extent defined over a Box.  
 	    Every discrete point that falls within the Box is assigned
 	    a value of the type <T>
Shift: A Point where a nonzero entry corresponds to an offset relative
       to the reference Point in space.
Stencil: A collection of shifts with corresponding coefficients. When
	 a Stencil is applied to a RectMDArray, every data point in
	 the destination container is the weighted sum of the value
	 contained in the data points corresponding to each shift, multiplied	
	 by the correspongind coefficient.

Two extremely simple examples of the use of Stencil class are included,
they are in tests/ subdirectory.
identity.cpp is a test that essentially does a copy using a single shift
              stencil, where all entires in the shift are zero and coefficient is one

laplacian.cpp applies the laplacian operator on the given source box.
