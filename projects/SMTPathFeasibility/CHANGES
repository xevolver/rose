Changed src/smtQueryLib.cpp 
--
to remove the unnecessary loop from SgVariableDeclaration. I thought I had to get the pointer via

SgInitializedNamPtrList List = varDecl->get_variables();

and then get the first one. Instead you can use

SageInterface::getFirstInitializedName(varDecl);

thus removing an obnoxious loop that worked but was very clunky.
