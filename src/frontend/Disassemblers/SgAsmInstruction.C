 *  are others also.
 *
 *  The following information about x86 no-ops is largely from Cory Cohen at CMU/SEI. In the discussion that follows, we are

 *  effect is to advance the instruction pointer).

 * @code

 *  90                   nop
 *
 *  89c0                 mov eax,eax            Intel's old recommended two-byte no-op was to
 *  89c9                 mov ecx,ecx            move a register to itself...  The second byte of these are mod/rm
 *  89d2                 mov edx,edx            bytes, and can generally be substituded wherever you see 0xc0 in
 *  89db                 mov ebx,ebx            subsequent examples.
 *  89e4                 mov esp,esp

 *  89f6                 mov esi,esi
 *  89ff                 mov edi,edi
 *
 *  88c0                 mov al,al              The above are also available in 8-bit form with a leading byte of 0x88
 *  6689c0               mov ax,ax              and with an operand size prefix (0x66).
 *
 *  66666689c0           mov ax,ax              The prefixes can be repeated. One source seemed to imply that up to
 *                                              three are reliably supported by the actual Intel processors. ROSE supports
 *                                              any number up to the maximum instruction size (varies by mode).
 *
 *  6688c0               mov al,al              The operand size prefix can even be nonsensical.
 *
 *  8ac0                 mov al,al              These are also presumabely no-ops.  As with most instructions, these will
 *  8bc0                 mov eax,eax            accept operand size prefixes as well.
 *
 *  f090                 lock nop               Most of these instructions will accept a lock prefix as well, which does
 *  f0f090               lock nop               not materially affect the result. As before, they can occur repeatedly, and
 *  f066f090             lock nop               even in wacky combinations.
 *  f066f06666f0f066f090 lock nop
 *  
 *  f290                 repne nop              Cory Cohen strongly suspects that the other instruction prefixes are
 *  f390                 rep nop                ignored as well, although to be complete, we might want to conduct a few
 *  2690                 es nop                 tests into the behavior of common processors.

 *  8d00                 lea eax,[eax]          Intel's old recommendation for larger no-ops was to use the LEA
