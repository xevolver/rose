/** Base class for engines driving the partitioner.
 *
 *  An engine serves these main purposes:
 *
 *  @li It holds configuration information related to disassembling and partitioning and provides methods for initializing that
 *      configuration information.
 *
 *  @li It provides methods for creating components (disassembler, partitioner) from stored configuration information.
 *
 *  @li It provides methods that implement the basic steps a program typically goes through in order to disassemble a specimen,
 *      such as parsing the binary container, mapping files and container sections into simulated specimen memory, calling a
 *      dynamic linker, disassembling and partitioning, and building an abstract syntax tree.
 *
 *  @li It provides a set of behaviors for the partitioner that are suitable for various situations.  For instance, the engine
 *      controls the order that functions and basic blocks are discovered, what happens when the partitioner encounters
 *      conflicts when assigning basic blocks to functions, etc.
 *
 *  Use of an engine is entirely optional.  All of the engine's actions are implemented in terms of public APIs on other
 *  objects such as @ref Disassembler and @ref Partitioner.  In fact, this particular engine base class is disigned so that
 *  users can pick and choose to use only those steps they need, or perhaps to call the main actions one step at a time with
 *  the user making adjustments between steps.
 *
 *  @section extensibility Custimization
 *
 *  The actions taken by an engine can be customized in a number of ways:
 *
 *  @li The engine can be subclassed. All object methods that are intended to be overridable in a subclass are declared as
 *      virtual.  Some simple functions, like those that return property values, are not virtual since they're not things that
 *      one normally overrides.  This engine's methods are also designed to be as modular as possible--each method does exactly
 *      one thing, and higher-level methods sew those things together into sequences.
 *
 *  @li Instead of calling one function that does everything from parsing the command-line to generating the final abstract
 *      syntax tree, the engine breaks things into steps. The user can invoke one step at a time and make adjustments between
 *      steps.  This is actually the most common custimization within the tools distributed with ROSE.
 *
 *  @li The behavior of the @ref Partitioner itself can be modified by attaching callbacks to it. In fact, if the engine is
 *      used to create a partitioner then certain engine-defined callbacks are added to the partitioner.
 *
 *  @section basic Basic usage
 *
 *  The most basic use case for the engine is to pass it the command-line arguments and have it do everything, eventually
 *  returning an abstract syntax tree.
 *
 *  @code
 *   #include <rose.h>
 *   #include <Partitioner2/Engine.h>
 *   using namespace rose;
 *   namespace P2 = rose::BinaryAnalysis::Partitioner2;
 *
 *   int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
 *       std::string purpose = "disassembles a binary specimen";
 *       std::string description =
 *           "This tool disassembles the specified specimen and presents the "
 *           "results as a pseudo assembly listing, that is, a listing intended "
 *           "for human consumption rather than assembly.";
 *       SgAsmBlock *gblock = P2::Engine().frontend(argc, argv, purpose, description);
 *  @endcode
 *
 *  @section topsteps High level operations
 *
 *  While @ref frontend does everything, it's often useful to break it down to individual steps so that adjustments can be made
 *  along the way. This next level of steps are:
 *
 *  @li Parse the command-line to adjust engine settings. See @ref parseCommandLine.
 *
 *  @li Parse binary containers to create a container abstract syntax tree.  This step parses things like section tables,
 *      symbol tables, import and export tables, etc. but does not disassemble any instructions.  See @ref parseContainers.
 *
 *  @li Create a memory map that simulates process address space for the specimen.  This consists of running a dynamic linker,
 *      loading raw data into the simulated address space, and adjusting the memory map . All of these steps are optional. See
 *      @ref loadSpecimens.
 *
 *  @li Create a partitioner.  The partitioner is responsible for driving the disassembler based on control flow information
 *      obtained by examining previously disassembled instructions, user-specified configuration files, command-line switches,
 *      etc. See @ref createPartitioner.
 *
 *  @li Run partitioner.  This step uses the disassembler and partitioner to discover instructions, basic blocks, data blocks,
 *      and functions and updates the partitioner's internal data structures. See @ref runPartitioner.
 *
 *  @li Create an abstract syntax tree from the partitioner's data structures.  Most of ROSE is designed to operate on an AST,
 *      although many binary analysis capabilities are built directly on the more efficient partitioner data structures.
 *      Because of this, the partitioner also has a mechanism by which its data structures can be initialized from an AST.
