     \brief This class represents the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) Intermediate Repesentation (IR) used within ROSE.

     These classes have been reconstructed to be consistant with the Sage II implementation built by Dennis
     Gannon (and others).  With Dennis's permission we have called this work Sage III.

\section what What is SAGE III?

   Sage III is the 3rd iteration of an intermediate representation well suited to
   source-to-source level processing of high level languages (C++, in particular).
   Sage III is used within the ROSE project and had been developed as part of the 
   ROSE project using parts of the original Sage II source code.  Substantial work 
   has gone into SAGE III, beyond that done in Sage II.  We would like to thank
   the original Sage developers to there work.
