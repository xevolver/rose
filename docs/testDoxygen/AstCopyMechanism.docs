 *  @ingroup old_documentation
 *
 *  The AST copy mechanism is to deep-copy parts of an AST.
 * 
 *  @section esign Design
 * 
 *  The AST copy mechanism is supported by a member function on each IR node called @c copy.  A parameter to the @c copy
 *  member function permits the user to tailor the copy mechanism to do deep or shallow copies within selected portions of the
 *  AST.
 * 
 * @todo Most types are shared, but named types are copied, and the copies need to have their declarations reset to the new
 *       AST. [prior to 2015-05-15]
 * 
 * @todo Base class modifiers are shared and this should be fixed. [prior to 2015-05-15]
 * 
 * @todo Friend function in classes are not represented by symbols in the global scope. Not that this is always the rule, it is
 *       the default for ROSE and it is setup inconsistantly in the generated AST copy.  See copytest2007_39.C. [prior to
 *       2015-05-15]
 * 
 * @todo copytest2007_46.C is too difficult to figure out (likely because the SgTemplateArguments are shared). [prior to
 *       2015-05-15]
 * 
 * @todo copytest2007_47.C is too complex and likely demonstrates an error. [prior to 2015-05-15]
 * 
 * @todo copytest2007_49.C is too complex and likely demonstrates an error. [prior to 2015-05-15]
 *
 * @todo This page needs a cross reference to the functions that implement copying. [Robb P. Matzke 2015-05-15]
