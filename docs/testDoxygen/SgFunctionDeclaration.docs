\class SgFunctionDeclaration
\brief This class represents the concept of a function declaration statement.

A function declaration can be either a forward declaration or a defining declaration.
If it is a defining declaration then it contains a pointer to the function definition.
Future work will allow this class to have a valide defining and non-defining declaration
similar to the class declaration, but this is not yet implemented.

This class is used as a base class for member function declarations and both template 
functions and template member function declarations.

The name of the function is stored in "p_name". However, if the function is a constructor
or destructor the value of "p_name" is ignored (should be unset, perhaps) and the name is
generated from the unqualified class name.  This handles the complexity of resetting
templated names which likely have been stored in the constructor before the template
names have been reset from the form "ABC____L8" to "ABC<int>" as requied to compile the
unparsed code.

\internal This is a base class for all function and member declaration statments
(including templated functions and member functions).

\todo Need to mark function declarations appearing in the file
rose_edg_required_macros_and_functions.h as compiler generated
since they are either builtin functions for gcc and g++ or those those
builtin function that gcc and g++ required and which EDG fails to include
as builtin when compiling with EDG's GNU_COMPATABILITY_MODE (current 
default for ROSE).

\todo Need to better handle fiend injection rules, currently the SgFunctionSymbol
for a friend function is placed into the global scope.  It likely should be
the outer scope for a non-defining declaration and the class scope for a defining 
declaration.  But the exact rules for this are more complex.  So the location
of the SgFunctionSymbol in the symbol table of SgGlobal is a poor approximation.

/*! \var SgFunctionDeclaration::p_name
\brief This variable stores the string representing the function name. 

This variable stores the string representing the function name.  The value is
ignored in the case of a member function constructor or destructor (where upon the
name returned from get_name() is generated from the class name). This handling is
important for constructors and constructor initializer handling associated with 
instantiated template class declarations).

The name of the function is stored in "p_name". However, if the function is a constructor
or destructor the value of "p_name" is ignored (should be unset, perhaps) and the name is
generated from the unqualified class name.  This handles the complexity of resetting
templated names which likely have been stored in the constructor before the template
names have been reset from the form "ABC____L8" to "ABC<int>" as requied to compile the
unparsed code.

\brief This variable stores the function parameters (as declared).

This variable stores the function parameters. The names and types are 
stored as they are declared so different for old K&R C style from newer C
style (both of which are acdeptable within ANSI C!).

*/

/*! \var SgFunctionDeclaration::p_functionModifier
\brief This variable stores flags representing use of inline, virtual, etc.

This variable stores what the C++ grammar referes to as "function modifiers".
Values held here are: inline, virtual, pure virtual, default, explicit.

*/

/*! \var SgFunctionDeclaration::p_specialFunctionModifier
\brief This variable stores flags representing use of constructor, destructor, etc.

This variable stores what the C++ grammar referes to as "special function modifiers".
Values held here are: default, not special, constructor, destructor, conversion operator,
operator.

\brief This variable stores the SgFunctionType.

This variable stores the SgFunctionType.  All types are shared within
the Sage III AST.

This variable stores a list of expressions that decorate this function. This member
is intended for use with Python, and should be NULL otherwise.

\brief This variable stores the SgFunctionDefinition.

This variable stores the SgFunctionDefinition. It is presently NULL if
the declaration is a forward declaration.  This will be made more uniform
with how defining vs. non-defining declarations are handled in the 
SgClassDeclaration.

\deprecated This is now redundant with the more general mechanism of defining and
non-defining declarations which is implemented at the SgDeclaration level.

\internal The handling via defining and non-defining declaration for function declarations
is not yet implemented and will be implemented similar to that done for class 
declarations.

This variable stores the string representing the mangled function name.
This name is unique within the AST (as required by C and C++ language definition).

/*! \var SgFunctionDeclaration::p_orig_return_type
\brief This variable stores the SgType pointer representing the function return type.

This variable stores the function return type (SgType).  All types are shared within
the Sage III AST.  Not clear why it is called the "original return type" since functions
can't be overloaded upon their return type (virtual or otherwise).

/*! \var SgFunctionDeclaration::p_from_template
\brief This boolean variable records if the function originally came from a template
function (now largely redundant information).

This boolean variable records if the function originally came from a template
function (now largely redundant information).  The IR now has a special type for
functions that are instantiated from function templates. 

\deprecated This variable will likely be removed in the future.

\internal This value is ALWAYS true for a SgTemplateInstantiationFunctionDecl and 
SgTemplateInstantiationMemberFunctionDecl; otherwise it is ALWAYS false.

/*! \var SgFunctionDeclaration::p_oldStyleDefinition
\brief This boolean variable records if the function uses the old style definition.

This boolean variable records if the function was declared using the old style
definition.

\internal This should maybe be moved to the SgFunctionParameterList class.

\fn SgFunctionDeclaration::isTemplateFunction () const
\brief Determines if function is a template or non-template function.

This function returns true if the current function is explicitly declared to be a
template function. It returns fals if it is a normal function, member function, or 
member function of a templated class.

\internal This function is required because member function of template are represented by
SgTemplateInstantiationMemberFunction IR nodea the same as explicitly templated 
member functions.  This function helps distinguish between the two types and is
used in determining which functions to output as template specializations (which
is now ROSE puts out template instantiations that it generates).

\return Returns bool value.
