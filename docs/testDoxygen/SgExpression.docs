\class SgExpression
\brief This class represents the notion of an expression. Expressions
are derived from SgLocatedNodes, since similar to statement, expressions
have a concrete location within the user's source code.

There are no direct uses of this IR node anywhere.  All expressions
are derived from this IR node to build derived classes such as unary and
binary operators, conditional expressions, delete expression, variable 
reference expressions, etc.

\note The SgExpression class has a virtual get_type() member function which returns
the type associated with any expression.  The get_type() support has the following 
properties:
   - The type is not explicitly stored in the IR, except for:
      -# SgCastExp
      -# SgNewExp
      -# SgAssignInitializer
      -# SgAggregateInitializer
      -# SgConstructorInitializer
      -# SgVarArgOp
      -# SgVarArgStartOp
      -# SgVarArgEndOp
      -# SgVarArgCopyOp
      -# SgVarArgStartOneOperandOp
   - Binary operators return the type associated with the lhs operand, except for (which
    return the type associated with the rhs operand):
      -# SgDotExp
      -# SgArrowExp
      -# SgDotStarOp
      -# SgArrowStarOp
   - Unary operators return the type of their operand
   - Value expressions return predefined types (that or their value)
   - Other special cases include:
      -# SgPntrArrRefExp, returns the element type of the array being referenced by the
         lhs (non-trivial implementation), must handle cases of:
         -# SgArrayType
         -# SgPointerType
         -# SgTypedefType
      -# SgPointerDerefExp, returns the type of the dereferenced pointer (non-trivial
         implementation), must handle cases of:
         -# SgArrayType
         -# SgPointerType
         -# SgTypedefType
         -# SgReferenceType
         -# SgFunctionType
         -# SgMemberFunctionType
      -# SgAddressOfOp, creates a pointer to the base type which is stored internally.
      -# SgFunctionCallExp, returns the return type of the function being called (except
         in special cases, this might require more work later).  Migration to the correct
         implementation is more complex due to requirements of backward compatability with
         older design.
      -# SgSizeOfOp, returns SgTypeUnsignedInt
      -# SgTypeIdOp, returns type of stored operand (not clear if this is correct)
      -# SgConditionalExp, tests for matching of types from true and false branches, but
         returns type associated with true branch. The types from each branch frequently
         don't match in application codes.
      -# SgDeleteExp, returns SgTypeVoid (used to return SgDefaultType)
      -# SgExprListExp, returns SgDefaultType, but should return type of last expression.
      -# SgVarRefExp, returns the type associated with the SgSymbol stored internally.
      -# SgFunctionRefExp, returns the type associated with the SgSymbol stored
         internally.
      -# SgMemberFunctionRefExp, returns the type associated with the SgSymbol stored
         internally.
      -# SgThisExp, returns a SgPointerType constructed from the type of the class symbol
         (stored inteernally).
      -# SgEnumVal, returns a SgTypeInt
      -# SgLongLongIntVal, returns SgTypeLong (should return SgTypeLongLong)
      -# SgNewExp, returns a pointer to p_specified_type (explicitly stored there)
   - Logical operators return SgTypeInt, these include:
      -# SgAndOp
      -# SgOrOp
      -# SgNotOp
      -# All others operate as a SgBinaryOp (type of lhs operand) or SgUnaryOp (type of
         operand). not clear if this is the correct behavior.
   - The following expressions return a SgTypeDefault:
      -# SgThrowOp
      -# SgNullExpression
      -# SgVariantExpression


\note get_type() vs. get_expression_type(). Note that there is of some IR nodes a
get_expression_type() which is always a data access function to a stored type.
The get_expression_type() function is for \b internal \b use \b only.
Where used, this function can return NULL if the explicitly stored
p_expression_type variable is not needed (this is to support it later
being removed). Although the type should be computed most of the time, there are 
some IR nodes where it must be stored explicitly (detailed above; for example where the 
SgTypeDefault is used and for SgCastExp, etc.). The function get_expression_type()
is not a part of the user interface and users should call get_type() instead.

\internal This is a base class for all expressions.
As a design point IPR has an empty expression, not an empty statement. And empty statement can 
be built as an expression statement with an empty expression (which IPR does have).
We should consider having such an empty expression.  Currently we have and
expression statement with a null pointer (none too elegant). Sage III now has both a 
SgNullStatement and a SgNullExpression.

\todo Consider placing the VARARGS expression nodes into a common base class
derived from SgExpression.

\todo I have removed the access functions from the explicit storage of type information in
SgExpression objects as phase 1 of a 2 phase approach to eliminate the storage of the
type in the SgExpression IR nodes.  This type should be computed where required.
This would avoid it being held redundently.  This mechanism is being redone
internally.  Some IR nodes will have likely have to store there type explicaitly
(function expressions for example, though it might be better computed through the
symbol).  It is not clear it this computing of the type will be better than stroing of
the type explicitly.  It might be required for SgBinaryOp IR nodes to store the type
if it is not clearly from either the lhs or rhs (if no simple rule exists).

\todo SgScopeOp is deprecated and will be removed in a future version of ROSE.
It is a hold over from support for CC++ which is not supported in SAGE III anymore.

\todo SgRefExp is deprecated and will be removed in a future version of ROSE.
It is not used anywhere within SAGE III and I don't know why it is there.

\todo Need to find an example of where SgClassNameRefExp is used.  It is build in
the EDG/Sage III translation, but not in a way that it is obvious that it is
still used within Sage III.  So this may have to be removed at a latr date.

\todo To support Fortran parser we need an IR node which will represent the
ambiguity of an array access or function call expression.  These are
then resolved within the AST after parsing (requires AST Fixup rule).

\todo Fortran support requires support for function call using: "foo(temp=*<label>)"
this might force the development of a label expression to support this.
Code using this compiles with gfortran, so it appears to be F90.

This boolean value marks the current expression as requiring parenthises (the

almost always overly conservative.  The unparser currently backs out more
accurate rules based on operator precedence and removed then where they
are not truely required.  Thus the purpose of this variable is to capture the
interpritation of the frontend regarding the use of parenthesis.

\fn SgExpression::get_need_paren (void) const
\brief returns bool value if front-end considers parenthesis to be required.

This function returns a boolean value which is true if parenthesis are required
for the proper eveluation of the current expression.  The frontend is however overly
conservative and introduces parenthesis too often.  The value as determined by the 
frontend is saved in the SAGE III AST because it is sometimes required for more
complex expressions and contructor calls with initializers.  At present the
unparser applies operator precedence rules to eliminate some of the redundent
parenthesis within expressions (this makes the output more appealing).

"Almost definable" here means as defined by the Fortran standard (2.5.5), with the caveat that allocatable variables are always called an lvalue.
The Fortran standard dictates that an allocatable variable which has not been allocated is not definable.
In the general case, it cannot be statically determined whether an allocatable variable has been allocated or not.
