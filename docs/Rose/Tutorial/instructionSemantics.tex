\chapter{Instruction Semantics}

The Instruction Semantics layer in ROSE can be used to ``evaluate''
instructions and is controlled by a policy that defines the details of
what ``evaluate'' means.  For instance, given the following ``xor''
instruction, the instruction semantics classes specify that the
value of the ``eax'' and ``edx'' registers are read, those two 32-bit
values are xor'd together, and the 32-bit result is then written to
the ``eax'' register. The policy defines what a 32-bit value is (it
could be an integer, some representation of a constant, etc), how it
is read and written to the registers, and how to compute an xor.

\begin{verbatim}
xor eax, edx
\end{verbatim}

ROSE has a collection instruction semantic classes, one for each
architecture. It also has a small collection of policies.  This
chapter briefly describes a policy that tracks constant values.

See the doxygen documentation for namespace
rose::BinaryAnalysis::InstructionSemantics2 for details.
