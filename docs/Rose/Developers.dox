// This module serves as the top level for all developer-specific documentation which probably shouldn't be in the list of
// pages that are presented to non-developer users.  That's why it's a @defgroup instead of a @page. [Robb P. Matzke 2015-09-26]

/** @defgroup developer_docs Library developers and collaborators
 *  @brief Documentation oriented toward those working on ROSE.
 *
 *  This documentation is mostly for those who work on the ROSE library or who work closely with the library development team. */
