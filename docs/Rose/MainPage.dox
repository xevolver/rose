 *     <td>Developed at [Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory](https://llnl.gov) (LLNL), ROSE is an open source compiler
 *         infrastructure to build source-to-source program transformation and analysis tools for large-scale C (C89 and C98),
 *         C++ (C++98 and C++11), UPC, Fortran (77, 95, 2003), OpenMP, Java, Python, PHP, and Binary applications.  ROSE users
 *         range from experienced compiler researchers to library and tool developers who may have minimal compiler
 *         experience. ROSE is particularly well suited for building custom tools for static analysis, program optimization,
 *         arbitrary program transformation, domain-specific optimizations, complex loop optimizations, performance analysis,
 *         and cyber-security.</td>

 * @section mainpage_goal Goal
 *
 * The primary goal of the ROSE project is to optimize applications within the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE).
 *
 * ROSE aims to be:
 *
 * @li A library (and set of associated tools) to quickly and easily apply compiler techniques to one's code in
 *     order to improve application performance and developer productivity.
 * @li A research and development compiler infrastructure for for writing custom source-to-source translators to
 *     perform source code transformations, analysis, and optimizations.
 *
 *
 * 
 * @section mainpage_approach Approach
 *
 * @li Cutting-edge research on source- and high-level compiler analysis and optimization algorithms.
 * @li Best-practice software development to incorporate existing compiler techniques to and develop new ones.
 * @li  Pre-built ROSE tools to perform program transformation, analysis and optimization of source code.
 * @li An easy-to-use API to build customized, domain-specific compiler-based analysis, transformation,
 *     and optimization tools.

 * @section mainpage_next Next steps
 *
 *  ROSE is an open source project that can be installed from source code. See @ref installation.
 *
 *
 *
 *  @todo The "all-versions" link doesn't work yet.  Eventually that link will point back into the top of the documentation for
 *        each released version of ROSE, both older and newer than this version. [Robb P. Matzke 2015-09-26]
 *
 *  @todo The links to the "ROSE tutorial" (at least the source code part) and the "ROSE user manual" are to versions
 *        served from http://rosecompiler.org, which might not match this release of ROSE. A better approach might be to use
 *        relative linking: it would point to a version consistent with the documentation you're now reading, including the
 *        case when a user generates their own local copies and has no Internet connection. These documents may move into
 *        doxygen, in which case this is no longer an issue. [Robb P. Matzke 2015-09-25]
 *
 *  @todo We have two sources of research publications. They need to be combined. [Robb P. Matzke 2015-09-25]
 *
 *  @todo We have two sources for "outreach" that need to be combined: one at rosecompiler.org and the other on the
 *        doxygen-generated mainpage.  Both are out of date. [Robb P. Matzke 2015-09-26]
 *
 *  @todo The "Hightlights" (sic) page says "Recent highlights" but the last one is from 2012. [Robb P. Matzke 2015-09-26] */
